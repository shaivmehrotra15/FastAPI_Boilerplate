# FastAPI Blog Backend Boilerplate

This repository contains a FastAPI boilerplate for building a powerful blog backend that performs CRUD operations, user creation, user authentication, and authorization using sessions, hashing with bcrypt, and JSON web tokens.

## Features

- **FastAPI**: Utilize the speed and performance of FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **CRUD Operations**: Ready-to-use endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts, users, and more.
- **User Creation**: Implement user registration functionality with email validation.
- **User Authentication**: Securely authenticate users with sessions and JSON web tokens (JWT).
- **Authorization**: Define different user roles and permissions to control access to certain API endpoints.
- **Password Hashing**: Safeguard user passwords by hashing them using bcrypt before storage.
- **Database**: Pre-configured support for SQLAlchemy to interact with the database.
- **Pydantic Schemas**: Use Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.
- **Testing**: Includes unit tests to ensure the functionality of the API.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the blog backend up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FastAPI_Boilerplate.git
   cd fastapi-blog-boilerplate
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the database:

   - Create a PostgreSQL database and update the database URI in the `app/config.py` file.

4. Run the migrations:

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

6. The FastAPI server should now be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Documentation

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are available in the API:

- **POST /user/**: Register a new user with email and password.
- **POST /authentication/login**: Log in with email and password to obtain a JSON web token.
- **GET /user/{user_id}**: Get the current user's details.
- **POST /blog/**: Create a new blog post.
- **GET /blog/{post_id}**: Get a specific blog post by ID.
- **GET /blog/**: Get all blogs post.
- **PUT /blog/{post_id}**: Update a blog post by ID.
- **DELETE /blog/{post_id}**: Delete a blog post by ID.

## Testing

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest
```
